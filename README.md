# RPNetworkCamera_Android

Remote control camera android app for [RPCameraInterface](https://github.com/RandomPrototypes/RPCameraInterface). 
Still a prototype, not cleaned yet. 
Features : 
* MJPG preview
* Timestamp synchronization
* On-device recording and video transfer when finished

Useful if you want to remote control a high resolution recording on device while having a low resolution preview streamed by wifi.
